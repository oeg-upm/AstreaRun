If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the removal of the engine from my car\n- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE80(x) ⊃ E11(x)"@en ;

For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.\n\nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.\n\nThis definition coincides with the definition of \"fiat objects\" (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of \"bona fide objects\".\n\nExamples:\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great\n- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza\n- Michael Jackson's nose prior to plastic surgery\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE26(x) ⊃ E18(x)"@en ;

All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as \"short cuts\" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.\n\nIn particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.\n\nExamples:\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr's silver cup in February 1997\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE13(x) ⊃ E7(x)"@en ;

They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, Place and Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of a spacetime volume is trivially its projection on time.\n\nExamples:\n- the spacetime Volume of the Event of Ceasars murder \n- the spacetime Volume where and when the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996  took place \n- the spatio‐temporal trajectory of the H.M.S.

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered \"new\" if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \"new\" because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.\n\nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.\n\nAn event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen\n- Rembrandt's creating of the seventh state of his etching \"Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove\", 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE12(x) ⊃ E11(x)\nE12(x) ⊃ E63(x)"@en ;

Objects to which parts are added are, by definition, man-made, since the addition of a part implies a human activity. Following the addition of parts, the resulting man-made assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Collection over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the setting of the koh-i-noor diamond into the crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother\n- the addition of the painting \"Room in Brooklyn\" by Edward Hopper to the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE79(x) ⊃ E11(x)"@en ;

The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\n\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved.

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\n\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring\n- the place referred to in the phrase: \"Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone\"\n- here -> <-\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE53(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en ;

For instance, in the case of a set of cutlery we may require the majority of pieces having been in the hands of the actor regardless which individual pieces are kept over time. \n\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery\n- the return of Picasso's \"Guernica\" to Madrid's Prado in 1981\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE10(x) ⊃ E7(x)"@en ;

Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.\n\nSince our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely.  An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known.\n\nAutomatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.\n\nExamples:\n- 1961\n- from 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996\n- 14h30 - 16h22 4th July 1945\n- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999\n- duration of the Ming Dynasty\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE52(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en ;

        sh:description  "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\nJurassic\nEuropean Bronze Age\nItalian Renaissance\nThirty Years War\nSturm und Drang\nCubism\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE4(x) ⊃ E2(x)\nE4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en ;

        sh:description  "Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, man-made or natural.\n\nDepending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.\n\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.\n\nWe model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.\n\nExamples:\n- the Cullinan Diamond (E19)\n- the cave \"Ideon Andron\" in Crete (E26)\n- the Mona Lisa (E22)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE18(x) ⊃ E72(x)\nE18(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en ;

An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\n\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\n\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as \"preferred identifier assignment\", to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.\n\nExamples:\n- Replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- Assigning the author-uniform title heading \"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832. Faust. 1. Theil.\" for a work (E28)\n- On June 1, 2001 assigning the personal name heading \"Guillaume, de Machaut, ca. 1300-1377\" (E42,E82) to Guillaume de Machaut (E21)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE15(x) ⊃ E13(x)"@en ;

It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of right. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:\n\n1. the beginning of ownership\n2. the end of ownership\n3. the transfer of ownership\n4. the acquisition from an unknown source\n5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item\n\nIt may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the collection of a hammer-head shark of the genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes) XXXtbc by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on March 25th, 1940\n- the acquisition of El Greco's \"The Apostles Peter and Paul\" by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg\n- the loss of my stuffed chaffinch 'Fringilla coelebs Linnaeus, 1758' due to insect damage last year\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE8(x) ⊃ E7(x)"@en ;

These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an E74 Group (cf.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names. \n\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Stonehenge\n- the hole in the ozone layer\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics\n- the Bermuda Triangle\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE77(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en ;
