The primary purpose is to indicate that several events will have very similar content, to aid planning what to attend. It does not indicate that there is any reason people could not attend more than one realisation. It should not be used to abstract a repeating event, such as morning coffee or a monthly meeting.\n\n\nMultiple Events may reference that they are realises of the same Activity. \nActivities are not Events and may not have a time or place." ;

A single event may be described by several programmes, for example one may give a break down by day, another by rooms, another by topic.\n\nA programme should not have Timeslots or Events if it subprogrammes. In effect this means there are two subclasses of Programme, but there's no need to express that in the data.\n\nA simple application only needs to operate on a single Programme at once." ;
